This project will create a new Silverlight 4.0 Out of Browser application that will expand upon the previous MegaMud scripting client to make a better game experience for all MajorMud players.

This project was formerly called the gigamud project on google code, however, that name has been taken by a different project and this will be a different project entirely.

## Recent Updates ##

I have added some basic layout for what I want the screens to look like.  Here are a few brief descriptions for the areas.

  1. The top area still needs menus, which I am going to add for quick tools and general management.
  1. Each character will be displayed in a separate tab.
  1. The main window content text, status and conversations will be on the left.
  1. The right side will be dedicated for customizable plugins that can be changed at runtime to display information depending on the user needs.
  1. Plugins will be able to expand to take up the entire right half for plugins that may need more space (displaying a map for example).

Just thought I would give a quick idea of where I would like to go with this.  Now it's time to start working on getting the automated login recording done, then it's off to the races with adding real functionality.
